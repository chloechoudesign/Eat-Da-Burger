## Description
- Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a 'Devour it!' button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
